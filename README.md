## Description

Singing Sands is a Python library for controlling the [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/) modular synthesis environment. It aims to provide a streamlined interface that's usable for live-coding and performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6 or greater.
* PureData - I'm testing with 0.48.1 - other version may well work but I don't know.

### Linux

* Clone or download the repository to a directory, `pyata`.

```
cd pyata
python3.6 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd pyata
pip install -e .
```

* Edit `pyata/properties.config` to set the location of your pd binary.
* `python ./scripts/make_a_noise.py`
